== Upload and Start Detection ==

Admin -> UI : Upload PCAP file
UI -> DB : connect()
UI -> SigIDS : detect(packets)

== Iterate Over Packets ==

loop for each packet
    SigIDS -> Pkt : Packet(pkt)
    SigIDS -> DB : reuse conn

    loop for each rule
        SigIDS -> Rule : Rule(rule)
        SigIDS -> Engine : match_rule(packet, rule)
        alt if matched
            SigIDS -> LA : create Log + Alert
            LA -> DB : add_to_log_table()
            LA -> DB : add_to_alert_table()
        end
    end
end

== End Detection ==

SigIDS --> UI : Detection Done (signature method)
UI -> Admin : Show logs + alerts (signature only)
